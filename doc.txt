📖 Reviews Dashboard – Documentation

A review management dashboard built with React, Vite, SCSS on the frontend and Node.js/Express on the backend.
It allows managers to fetch, filter, and manage guest reviews from Hostaway (or mock API) and control which reviews are displayed publicly.

Features

✔ Filters: Property, Category, Channel, Rating, Date
Managers can drill down reviews by property name (e.g., "Modern Loft in City Center").
Filter by review category (Cleanliness, Communication, Accuracy, Value, etc.).
Narrow down by channel (Airbnb, Booking, Hostaway).
Sort reviews based on rating ranges (high scores, mid-range, low).
Date-based filters allow viewing reviews from all time, last week, last month, or last quarter.

✔ Sidebar toggle (expand/collapse for compact/full view)
The filter sidebar can be expanded for detailed filtering.
Collapsed mode gives a wider view of review cards and charts.
Perfect for managers who want a minimal view while focusing on data.

✔ Bulk select & toggle publicDisplay
Select multiple reviews at once using checkboxes.
Perform bulk actions such as setting reviews to public (visible on property page) or private.
Saves time when managing large sets of reviews.

✔ Charts for visualizing ratings
Integrated with Recharts to show:
Distribution of ratings (high/medium/low).
Performance by category (cleanliness, communication, etc.).
Trends over time (review activity per week/month).
Helps managers spot patterns and improve guest experience.

✔ Styled to match Flex Living layout
The dashboard and property review components follow Flex Living’s design system.
Consistent fonts, colors, and spacing for seamless integration with the property details page.
Review carousel on public pages blends natively into the Flex Living property design.
